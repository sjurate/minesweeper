##  Minesweeper

Minesweeper is my favourite game! I had to delete it from both my laptop and my phone once, so it didn't disturb me from studying for exam session.  
So it was a pure pleasure to re-create it using JavaScript myself! And now I get hooked playing while testing it! 


Anyway, developing this game helped me to get more knowledge about recursion, manipulating DOM and to practise some in-built JS methods.
